    "        * Relative Frequency = Percent of frequency in that perticular column only\n",
    "        * We calculate column related frequency in percentage\n",
    "        * Sum of all rows percent in that column = 100%\n",

    "        * First plot the dot on top of Bar's in Bar graph and the connect the dots and finally remove the Bars.\n",
    "        * When we have to represent the trend data then we use Line graph.\n",

    "* **Central Tendency** :\n",
    "    * Central tendency is the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution of data.\n",

    "                * Data = [3, 5, 7] → Median = 5\n",
    "                * Data = [2, 4, 6, 8] → Median = (4 + 6)/2 = 5\n",

    "            * if all values are distinct then we can't find the Mode.\n",
    "            * if there are more then 1 mode then we can say it bimodal.\n",

    "* **Spread** :\n",
    "    * Spread is a measure of how much the data values differ from each other or from the average (mean) value.\n",
    "    * If the spread is small, the data points are close to each other.\n",
    "    * If the spread is large, the data points are widely scattered.\n",

    "        1. **Range** :\n",
    "            * Farmula: Range = Maximum Value − Minimum Value\n",

    "                * Data = [2, 5, 8, 10]\n",
