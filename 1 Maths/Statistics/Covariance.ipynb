    "# Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Covariance is a statistical measure indicating the extent to which two random variables change together. \n",
    "* It shows the direction, but not the strength, of their linear relationship. \n",
    "* A positive covariance suggests variables move in the same direction, while a negative value implies an inverse relationship. Zero covariance indicates no linear relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Here is the formula for the sample covariance between two variables $X$ and $Y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $$\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Where:\n",
    "        *   $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the individual data points.\n",
    "        *   $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Y}$ are the means (averages) of the $X$ and $Y$ variables, respectively.\n",
    "        *   $n$ is the number of data points (sample size).\n",
    "        *   $\\sum$ is the summation operator.\n"
